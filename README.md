# School_District_Analysis

## Overview

The main purpose of this analysis is to offer a view on the performance of the schools in the district, considering their type, assigned budget and size; as well as individualy.

## Results

This dataframe offers a general view of the results per school, though it does not allows to make a higher level analysis of trends that might allow us to better understand the performance of the schools in the district.

There seems to be a paradoxical realation between spending and passing rates, since the last seems to decrease as the spending per student increases, thhough it can be inferred that such correlation relies on the fact that students with lower grades might need a higher amount of funding to level with the rest.

It's visible that charter chools have better performance in both, reading and math, as well as in the averall passing rate; this can be understood by acknowledging the fact that charter schools tend to have greater accountability than district schools.

When considering the performance by size, it's important to first see the relation between the size and type of school; since most charter schools are int he medium range we can infere that it acn be a reason fo medium sized schools to perform better, much rather than there being a real dependency between the size and performance.

Reading and math average grades tend to be stable among all schools, which can be an indicator that as students move from one grade to the next the difficulty increases along sith their capabilities, mantaining the learning curve ahead.
